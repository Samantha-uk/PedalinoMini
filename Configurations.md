Some example configurations are provides. The default configuration for [PedalinoMini™ Case 1](https://github.com/alf45tar/PedalinoMini-Case-1) is available as 'case1'.

## iRig BlueBoard

PedalinoMini™ can emulate an [IK Multimedia iRig Blueboard](https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigblueboard/) using 'blueboard' configuration. Midi Mode 1 is on bank 1 and Midi Mode 2 is on bank 2. PedalinoMini™ emulation works on any MIDI interface and not only "MIDI over Bluetooth" as the original iRig Blueboard.

## Fender Mustang Amplifier

PedalinoMini™ can control a Fender Mustang I/II/III/IV Amplifier via MIDI. Additional [software](https://github.com/alf45tar/mustang-midi-bridge-win) is required to translate MIDI messages to the proprietary USB protocol used by Fender Mustang amplifiers. The bonus configuration is called 'mustang' and works with 3 momentary switches and 3 jog wheels.
